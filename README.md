# Route Area Mapping Tool

This React application provides an interactive map interface for creating and visualizing areas based on user-defined routes with the help of `react-leaflet` and `@turf/turf`. It allows users to plot routes on a map and generates areas around these routes with a specified offset. The application supports dynamically adjusting the offset distance and toggling the closure of the route to form a looped area.
